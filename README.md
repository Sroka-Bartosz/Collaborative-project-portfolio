## Project Descriptions

1. **Distributed-system-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-search**

   This project focuses on programming for distributed systems, with the main objective of monitoring the sky to detect
   radioactivity originating from beyond Earth. Independent research stations operate autonomously, collecting and
   transmitting data to a central server. The collected data is merged, stored in a database, and visualized for
   analysis. Multiple stations observing the same area contribute to the combined signal processed by the server. The
   project emphasizes distributed programming techniques.

2. **RevBook-project-book-review-database**

   The project was carried out to learn the creation and management of PostgreSQL databases using ORM queries with
   SQLAlchemy. It features a web page for managing book review submissions tailored to the project's specific database
   architecture.

3. **Medical-data-imputation-module**

   The aim of the project was to create a missing data imputation module to support project: "Mama w Koronie" conducted
   by the Institute of Public Health at the Collegium Medicum of Jagiellonian University. Provided data contained
   information on the mental and physical state of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. I conducted an analysis
   of the effectiveness of imputation methods, including random imputation, mean and median substitution, last
   observation carried forward (LOCF), hot-deck imputation, using kNN algorithm, MICE, linear regression, and Bayesian
   imputations. For selected methods, I analyzed their effectiveness based on the NRMSE error. As a result of my work, a
   module that enabled data imputation in the BI system was created.
