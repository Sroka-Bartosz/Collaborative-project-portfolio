# Collaborative-project-portfolio

This repository contains information about projects that have been carried out in collaboration with other individuals
and are located on GitHub. Here, you will find brief descriptions of these projects along with links to their respective
repositories.

## Project Descriptions

1. **RevBook-project-book-review-database**
   <b>[[LINK]](https://github.com/MARIAMJESTEM/AdvancedDatabases)</b>

   The project was carried out to learn the creation and management of PostgreSQL databases using ORM queries with
   SQLAlchemy. It features a web page for managing book review submissions tailored to the project's specific database
   architecture.

   **Using:** Python (SQLAlchemy, Pandas), PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, ORM


2. **Allen-fuzzy-logs-relation-analysis**
   <b>[[LINK]](https://github.com/Sroka-Bartosz/Allen-fuzzy-logs-relation-analysis)</b>

   The project, which I co-created with two other people, involved developing methods for analyzing
   relationships that occur in business logs. Three methods were created to determine which Allen relationships occur
   between two events in the log. The software created is intended for the analysis of BPMN logs and can be used to
   optimize the task parallelization process. The methods require further work but represent an innovative approach
   to this type of analysis.

   **Results:** [Allen_fuzzy_logs_relation_analysis_report.pdf](Allen_fuzzy_logs_relation_analysis_report.pdf)

   **Using:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, pm4py), Jupyter Notebook, BPMN


3. **Medical-data-imputation-module**

   The aim of the project was to create a missing data imputation module to support project: "Mama w Koronie" conducted
   by the Institute of Public Health at the Collegium Medicum of Jagiellonian University. Provided data contained
   information on the mental and physical state of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. I conducted an analysis
   of the effectiveness of imputation methods, including random imputation, mean and median substitution, last
   observation carried forward (LOCF), hot-deck imputation, using kNN algorithm, MICE, linear regression, and Bayesian
   imputations. For selected methods, I analyzed their effectiveness based on the NRMSE error. As a result of my work, a
   module that enabled data imputation in the BI system was created.
   <b> Unfortunately, I cannot share the engineering project due to legally protected confidentiality </b>


4. **Child-mortality-prediction**
   <b>[[LINK]](https://github.com/Norbert-Podgorski/Child-Mortality-Prediction-Model)</b>

   The aim of the project was to create a model for child mortality, depending on
   selected factors that have an indirect impact on the modeled parameter. I was primarily responsible for data
   preprocessing, problem analysis, as well as interpreting and displaying the results.

   **Results:** [Child_mortality_prediction_report.pdf](Child_mortality_prediction_report.pdf)

   **Using:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, CmdStanModel), Jupyter Notebook, ARIMA, Stan


5. **Distributed-system-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-search**
   <b>[[LINK]](https://github.com/Artur-Mzyk/Distributed-Systems)</b>

   This project focuses on programming for distributed systems, with the main objective of monitoring the sky to detect
   radioactivity originating from beyond Earth. Independent research stations operate autonomously, collecting and
   transmitting data to a central server. The collected data is merged, stored in a database, and visualized for
   analysis. Multiple stations observing the same area contribute to the combined signal processed by the server. The
   project emphasizes distributed programming techniques.

   **Results:** [Distributed_system_report.pdf](Distributed_system_report.pdf)

   **Using:** Python (SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), PostgreSQL


6. **Tennis-league-tournament-optimization**
   <b>[[LINK]](https://github.com/Sroka-Bartosz/Tennis-league-tournament-optimization)</b>

   The project involved using a genetic algorithm with evolutionary strategy to create a tournament ladder that contains
   the most interesting (according to the weight function) matches. It was implemented by a group of six
   people, where my responsibilities included organizing work and assembling all the elements provided into
   a functional software. The created program allows for loading players and their statistics and determining the best
   tournament ladder.

   **Results:** [Tennis_league_tournament_optimization.pdf](Tennis_league_tournament_optimization.pdf)


7. **Queue-car-traffic-model**
   <b>[[LINK]](https://github.com/Sroka-Bartosz/Queue-car-traffic-model)</b>

   The project involved creating a simulation model for a traffic queue, specifically following the M|M|n|FIFO|inf queue
   type. The problem was solved both analytically and through simulations.

   **Results:** [Queue_car_traffic_model.pdf](Queue_car_traffic_model.pdf)

   **Using:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, QueueingTool) Jupyter Notebook
